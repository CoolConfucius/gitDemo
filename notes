git remote show origin 
shows you waht the fetch and push urls are. 


git checkout -b 

git pull --allow-unrelated-histories 


usually: 
master is your deployed version 
then you have stable
and development where you test features 
and feature branch where you make features. 

once your merge feature branches, you merge into develpoment. then development into master? 
then delete all feature branches. as they become stable, merge into dvelopment. merge into master. deploy master. 

always pull and then push 


git push origin development
