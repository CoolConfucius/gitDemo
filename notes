git remote show origin 
shows you waht the fetch and push urls are. 


git checkout -b 

git pull --allow-unrelated-histories 


usually: 
master is your deployed version 
then you have stable
and development where you test features 
and feature branch where you make features. 

once your merge feature branches, you merge into develpoment. then development into master? 
then delete all feature branches. as they become stable, merge into dvelopment. merge into master. deploy master. 

always pull and then push 


git push origin development 


pull, see up to date, then push. !!! 



commit often

if you break something severely, git stash, you go back to your previous commit


there are times when you don't want to add all the files 

git reset 

git add . is adding all changes 

git add style.css 

sometimes, you want to push 10 files. do you want to sit there? 
in this case, you want to add all and reset one 

git add . 
git reset index.html 


if you have 10 files, add everything, and reset the ones you don't want. sometimes you added a file for testing purposes.
